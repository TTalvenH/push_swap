# Push_swap
Push_swap is a project that challenged me to design and implement an algorithm that sorts a stack of integers using the following operations

- sa (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a.
- sb (swap b): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b.
- ss : sa and sb at the same time.
- pa (push a): Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a.
- pb (push b): Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b.
- ra (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack a by 1.
- rb (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack b by 1.
- rr : ra and rb at the same time.
